## Reason to complete the book :pencil:

This was given as a part of the introduction-syllabus to to Freshers at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/) who are in the [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/) club.

Every chapter folder contains what it took me to complete the projects of that chapter, external references I used and the blockers I faced during the completion of the task.

## Importance of this book in everyday life : nut_and_bolt :

It teaches how to use Python to write programs that do in minutes what would take you hours to do by hand with no need of prior programming experience.
